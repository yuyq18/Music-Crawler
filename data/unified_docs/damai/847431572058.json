    "project_info": "2019年Boiler Room第一次落脚深圳时这样形容了这个城市：“包容、热切，充满新鲜感，深圳的多元与融合背后是放眼亚洲都独一无二的青年文化。”5年后我们回到深圳，在俱乐部仍旧是自由精神居所的今天，在坚持于庞大数据流中涌动的场景里，再次探访这座城市孕育的生机勃勃的地下音乐场景。\nWhen Boiler Room’s camera first focused on Shenzhen in 2019, we said “Inclusive, enthusiastic and fresh. Behind Shenzhen's diversity and integration, there is the most unique youth culture in Asia.” Five years later we’re coming back! Clubs still are a form of catharsis or self-care here today, let’s dig some fresh vibrant ounds out of the thriving underground flow.\nPresented by Budweiser.",
